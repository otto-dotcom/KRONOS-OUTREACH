De BIM is een van de grootste spelers op de Bossche markt van bedrijfsonroerend goed. En dat is niet voor niets. Zo heeft de BIM een uitgebreid huuraanbod voor de gevestigde, creatieve en startende ondernemer. Niet iedere ondernemer zoekt hetzelfde. Daarom valt er wat te kiezen bij de BIM in Den Bosch.

Wij bieden ondernemers niet alleen een goede prijs-kwaliteitverhouding, maar ook de service van onze medewerkers. Vaak gaan wij net iets verder in onze dienstverlening naar onze huurders dan gebruikelijk in de markt. Dat is ook onze kracht.
