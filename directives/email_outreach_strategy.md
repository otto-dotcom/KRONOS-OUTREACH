# KRONOS Email Outreach Strategy (Swiss Real Estate)
Version: 1.0
Status: ACTIVE

## Goal
To deliver qualified consultations and steady lead flow for Swiss realtors through hyper-personalized, executive-level outreach.

## Voice & Tone
- **Swiss Elite**: Professional, direct, and outcome-oriented.
- **Bespoke Consulting**: Not an advertisement. A conversation between partners.
- **Precision**: Reference specific company data and local Swiss markets.

## Copywriting Framework (PAS)
1. **Problem**: Mention the inconsistent listing volumes or lead desync in the Swiss market.
2. **Agitation**: Focus on the lost "Steady Sales" and tactical time-waste.
3. **Solution**: KRONOS automated lead flow and qualified consultations.

## Visual Standards
- **Pixel-Retro**: Minimalist black borders, orange (#FF6B00) top banner, and pixelated font accents.
- **Official Logo**: Must be present at the top or in the signature of all HTML communications.

## Definition of Done
- Sent emails are max 5-6 sentences.
- Includes a direct "Steady Sales" value proposition.
- Branding complies with the official KRONOS Style Guide.
